# Reproducibility Study of Recommendation Systems - Master's Thesis 2023

This is my Master's Thesis concluding a successful 5-year study path in *Computer Science Engineering* @Politecnico di Milano.
<br>
For 8 months I worked in the research group RecSys Lab @ Polimi analyzing and reproducing the outcome of new Machine Learning recommender techniques published in leading international conferences.

Evaluation: 7/7

## Abstract:
The increasing popularity of Recommendation Systems, which aims at predicting the preferences or scores a user would assign to a set of items, is attributed to the growing interest in online platforms aligned with the vast amount of available data. These systems filter the information presenting the user with a precise subset of content ensuring the userâ€™s attention is directed towards the most significant items for them.
There is a variety of techniques that can be utilized for generating recommendations.
Frequently, these recommendations are crafted through the application of collaborative filtering techniques, which rely on the preference of an extensive user community to predict the most pertinent items for each single customer.
Over the past few years, there has been a notable surge in the exploration of integrating neural techniques such as Deep Learning into the recommender systems domain to enhance the quality of recommendations compared to traditional approaches.
The publication of numerous papers in leading international conferences, asserting superior results surpassing those achieved by traditional methods, has established this category of algorithms as predominant in the research field. Nevertheless, there is no unanimous acknowledgment of this success, and various papers have raised concerns regarding the actual attainment of the claimed results influenced by methodological errors.
In this work, we carried out a comprehensive set of experiments to reproduce the results presented in recently published papers from leading scientific conferences. We assessed the actual performance of newly proposed methods by following a precise and rigorous approach already used in previous studies.
The result of this analysis reveals that none of the reproducible papers consistently outperforms conceptually simple and well-established baseline methods. During our analysis, we identified several methodological issues and some technical errors providing some possible solutions to the reproducibility problem that characterizes the scientific research in this field.
